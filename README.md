# To-do-list

Another project that I am doing to test the basic skills.

1 - Created first documents. Luckily the git process isn't as new as it was previously.

2 - Wanted to start with the logic first this time. Wow...what a brain-teaser. Learnt a lot about propagation and listening to events on a higher level. Moving elements around and proper use of the correct HTML elements.

After many silly mistakes and frustrations, I think I finally finished the basic logic. All that is left to do is to make use of local storage to save and load the to-do list. What a gloriously frustrating but enjoyable two days.
